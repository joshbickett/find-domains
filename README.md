# find-domains

Interested in finding a domain for your next project but don't feel like searching GoDaddy 1,000 times? This repo contains a script (`main.py`) which makes it easy to search through a large list of domains to see what's available.

## steps

1. Get an API key at https://whois.whoisxmlapi.com/
2. Add the API key on line 4 of `main.py` where it says `API_KEY`
3. Add your `domains_to_check` in `main.py`
4. Run `python main.py` and see results

@#$QASEFASD!!! nevermind - I just found that the following tool exist so ignore this repo it is useless: https://www.godaddy.com/domains/bulk-domain-search
